### Hey!

Ever since I joined GitHub **0** years ago, I pushed **968** commits, opened **3** issues, submitted **8** pull requests, received **10** stars across **33** personal projects, and contributed to **12** public repositories.

I mostly write **TS** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

### Hey!

I'm someone who is passionate about **GNU/Linux** and likes to **write code**.

Ever since I joined GitHub **1** years ago, I pushed **1470** commits, opened **3** issues, submitted **4** pull requests, received **2** stars across **8** personal projects, and contributed to **3** public repositories.

I mostly write **TS** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

I'm migrating some repositories that are just notes to an [ B'Hobbies organization ](https://github.com/B-Hobbies)...

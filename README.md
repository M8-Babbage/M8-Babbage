Ever since I joined GitHub **0** years ago, I pushed **363** commits, opened **1** issues, submitted **2** pull requests, received **8** stars across **6** personal projects, and contributed to **3** public repositories.

I mostly write **Java** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

Also, here are a few interesting **projects** (written in **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**) that are worth mentioning:

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/M8-Babbage/Notes/tree/main/typescript) - Some notes about TypeScript with some examples.
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/M8-Babbage/Notes/tree/main/javascript) - Topics about JavaScript like array methods, async/await, etc.
- [Java](https://github.com/M8-Babbage/Java) - This is my Java path!
- [Angular](https://github.com/M8-Babbage/Angular) - Projects than have been built with Angular.

Ping me on discord `Babbage#5874` if you want to chat!

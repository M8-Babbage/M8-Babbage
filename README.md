### Hey!

Ever since I joined GitHub **0** years ago, I pushed **722** commits, opened **2** issues, submitted **7** pull requests, received **32** stars across **22** personal projects, and contributed to **10** public repositories.

I mostly write **TS** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

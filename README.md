### Hey!

I'm someone who is passionate about **GNU/Linux** and likes to **write code**.


Ever since I joined GitHub **0** years ago, I pushed **702** commits, opened **2** issues, submitted **7** pull requests, received **45** stars across **29** personal projects, and contributed to **10** public repositories.

I mostly write **TS** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

Also, here are a few interesting **projects** (written in **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**) that are worth mentioning:

- [Vue](https://github.com/M8-Babbage/Vue-TS-Vite) - I'm learning all about Vue!.
- [React](https://github.com/M8-Babbage/ToDo-React.git) - ToDo using React.
- [Angular](https://github.com/M8-Babbage/Angular) - Projects than have been built with Angular.
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/M8-Babbage/Notes/tree/main/typescript) - Some notes about TypeScript with some examples.

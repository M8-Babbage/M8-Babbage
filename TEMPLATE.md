### Hey!

I'm someone who is passionate about **GNU/Linux** and likes to **write code**.

Ever since I joined GitHub **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago, I pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, received **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects, and contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.

I mostly write **TS** these days. See my _pinned repositories_ below.

I'm migrating some repositories that are just notes to an [ B'Hobbies organization ](https://github.com/B-Hobbies)...
